# SortViz 🔄

## Interactive Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

SortViz is a modern, interactive web application that visualizes popular sorting algorithms in real-time. This educational tool helps users understand how different sorting algorithms work by providing step-by-step visual representations of the sorting process.

## ✨ Features

- **11 Sorting Algorithms**: Visualize and compare different sorting techniques
- **Adjustable Speed**: Control the visualization speed to observe the details
- **Variable Array Size**: Test algorithms with different data set sizes
- **Real-time Statistics**: Track comparisons, swaps, and execution time
- **Algorithm Information**: Learn about time and space complexity for each algorithm
- **Interactive Controls**: Start, pause, and reset visualizations
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## 🧮 Available Algorithms

SortViz includes the following sorting algorithms:

| Algorithm | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| Bubble Sort | O(n²) | O(1) |
| Selection Sort | O(n²) | O(1) |
| Insertion Sort | O(n²) | O(1) |
| Merge Sort | O(n log n) | O(n) |
| Quick Sort | O(n log n) - O(n²) | O(log n) |
| Heap Sort | O(n log n) | O(1) |
| Shell Sort | O(n log n) - O(n²) | O(1) |
| Counting Sort | O(n + k) | O(n + k) |
| Radix Sort | O(nk) | O(n + k) |
| Bucket Sort | O(n + k) | O(n + k) |
| Tim Sort | O(n log n) | O(n) |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JollyJolli/SortViz.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd SortViz
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your browser or use a local server:
   ```bash
   # Using Python's built-in server
   python -m http.server
   # or
   python3 -m http.server
   ```

## 🎮 How to Use

1. From the landing page, click on "Start Visualizing" to access the sorting visualization tool
2. Select a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu
3. Adjust the array size and sorting speed using the sliders
4. Click "Start" to begin the visualization
5. Use "Pause" to temporarily halt the visualization
6. Click "Reset" to generate a new random array

## 📚 Learn More

Each algorithm comes with detailed information about how it works, its time complexity, and space complexity. This makes SortViz not just a visualization tool but also an educational resource for learning about sorting algorithms.
